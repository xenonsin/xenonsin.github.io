			<p>On May 2nd, I participated in Game + Hack, which was held in Nickelodeon studios.</p>	
			<p>Zero to Hero is an RPG where your stats depend on what you do in real life. For example, increase your in-game strength by going to the gym, or run to increase your agility. This game acts as a productivity tool that allows you another visual form of progression besides your mirror or weighing scale. Progress through levels and defeat monsters by leading an active and balanced lifestyle!</p>
			<p>We tried to design a sort of system similar to fitocracy.com, where users are rewarded by logging activities they have accomplished. Unlike fitocracy, we tried to incorporate it in an actual game. Your stats would improve by an amount calculated by the type of activity and the duration. This, in turn, would affect the speed, the attack damage, and the health of your character.</p>
			<p>Here's what we were able to accomplish:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>&#8226; I implemented a&nbsp;back-end&nbsp;using Parse, to log all the users and their&nbsp;activities.</li>
			<li>&#8226; I also experimented a lot with the GUI. This is the first game I made that is GUI heavy, and I used Daikon Forge to help set up everything. (Because the default Unity GUI is atrocious.) I created whole menus and forms for users to send and receive data. Plus, I implemented an hp bar above characters so that hp can be tracked visually.&nbsp;</li>
			<li>&#8226; I also experimented and implemented a turn based system using Queues. I'm not sure if this is the most optimal method, but it worked for what I needed it to do.&nbsp;</li>
			<li>&#8226; I also implemented a simple Enemy AI that automatically attacks during its turn but pauses for a few seconds before initiating it so that enemies don't automatically end turn. (improves game feel, I think.)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Overall, it was surreal working inside Nickelodeon studios, and I learned a lot! Especially to at least google the title of your game, before failing to notice that it shares the same name as a really popular song from a company which directly competes with the company who's hosting the hackathon you're participating in... then quietly being disqualified.</p>

			The game was made using <b>Unity</b> and written in <b>C#</b>. Back end database service is handled using <b>Parse</b> and <b>JSON</b>. Art assets were created by Gemma using <b>Paint Tool Sai</b>.
